                <h2>Terrorist</h2>
                <p>The terrorist's job is to choose a plant site to go and plant a bomb at. He will have to kill all counter terrorists or plant the bomb and wait untill it explodes. The advantage that the terrorist has is that he can target one plant site to plant the bomb at. The advantage in this is that the other half of the counter terrorist team is at another plant site so the terrorists will only have to kill 2 or 3 counter terrorists.</p>
